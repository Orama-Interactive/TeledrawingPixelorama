# Teledrawing for Pixelorama
A free and open source extension for [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) that allows multiple people to collaborate on a single project (by going to Edit > Teledrawing).

This is still experimental and it's not recommended to use this yet, other than just playing around.
